##### Workflow Expectations

  * zoom / screensharing
  * driver / nav - skip over implied instruction
* Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques
  * 10 pull requests and 30 commits
  * 2 - 3 pull requests per iteration
  * constant commits - before each break and large chunks/features   

##### Team strengths & collaboration styles
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
  * encouraged learning - excitement
  * start with the pros to suggestions / ideas
  * defined / scheduled work time
* What is your collaboration style?
  * Talking through concepts
  * work through things independently - then regroup
* How would you describe your work style?
  * Revisit at a later date
* How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
  * divide-and-conquer - work together but separate
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?

##### Technical Strengths & Growth Expectations
* What are each of our strengths?
  * Technical: moderate
  * Soft: organized
* How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles?
* How can our strengths complement each other?
  * reassurance via pull requests

##### Communication Expectations
* How do you communicate best?
  * circumstantial - slack for quick and easy questions; calls for more complex problems/questions
* How and often will we communicate?
  * don't expect immediate response outside of dedicated project work time
* How do we keep lines of communication open?
  * slack thread
* How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?
  * Awareness and compartmentalize
  * Communication quality decreases during struggle
  * ask for what you need - ask for space when you need it.

* Proposed pom cadence:
  * animals to dictate

##### Expectations for giving and receiving feedback
* How do you appreciate receiving & giving feedback from others?
  * Direct - no fluff
  * Framing / lense of helping the other person be their best self
  * Impact vs feedback
    * How something impacted you emotionally vs directly impacted the task/project

 * more time prying together
 * better time mgmt - consider time to review and explain code and/or code logic
 * good at knowing when to take a break
 * setting time blocks with methods and asking for help sooner
 *

##### Additional questions that you would like to add
##### Re-DTR Notes
* Tuple and paired coding
* get through iteration 2 by end of weekend
* come prepared Monday to discuss the how to's of printing the grid
* if independent work is done - pair driver/navigator to re-write code together such that code is driven by initial author of solution and navigated by other partner to check for mutual understanding
